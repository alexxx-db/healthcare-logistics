    "Many healthcare systems manage assets or workforce that they need to deploy geographically. One example, is a community nursing team. These are teams of highly skilled nurses that must visit patients in their own home. Another example, is patient transport services where a fleet of non-emergency ambulances pick up patients from their own home and transport them to outpatient appointments in a clinical setting. These problems are highly complex. For example, in the community nursing example, patients will have a variety of conditions, treatments may be time dependent (for example, insulin injections), nurses will have mixed skills and staffing will vary over time.\n",

    "When working in logistics it is likely that you will need to employ some form of simple hill-climbing algorithm.  These are very simple algorithms that iteratively test neighbouring solutions to see if they find any improvement.  This **local search** approach is often very successful at finding reasonably good solutions to a routing and scheduling problem. You will see that you can easily out perform random search. However, hill climbers do suffer from getting stuck in a **local optimum** and you can often do better by employing a more sophisticated algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However,** you might be surprised at how useful hill-climbers turn out to be when used in combination with other approaches.  Here you will first experiment with a simple first improvement hill climber and then use it to **clean up** the solution produced by a evolutionary strategy and **combine** the framework into random search followed by hill climbing.  One of the key benefits of hill climbers is that they are relatively fast (because they are simple).  You can even set a time limit to get some of the benefit of local search without greatly extending the execution time of your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although this the approach is called Hill-Climbing in the TSP you are **descending** a hill to the find the shortest route. The algorithm is the same, but you are maximising -1*objective (or alternatively $\\dfrac{1}{objective}$).  \n"

Generally speaking `TweakTwoOpt` will produce better solutions, but it is worth considering a `SimpleTweak` approach when **cleaning up** the output of another algorithm.
